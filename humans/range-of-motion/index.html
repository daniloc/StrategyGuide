Even light has a maximum speed.</p><p>Our human universe is similarly constrained. It is possible to accomplish extraordinary things, but rarely all at once. Success in life is governed by your ability to make plans to cross the gulf between where you are and where you want to go.</p><p>Consider an airplane. It can take you extraordinary distances, but it can't fly forever. For a long enough journey, the plane must land, refuel, and perhaps change crews before continuing onward. Not all planes are created equal. Smaller planes have shorter limits before they need refueling. Larger planes can carry you further without interruption.</p><p>I call this idea, when applied to human beings, <em>range of motion</em>. The strategies you need to reach the places you want to go in life will be determined by your range of motion. But even if you feel hopelessly limited by your current range of motion, don't fear: it can be changed.</p><p>To understand how, let's begin by understanding some of the parameters that define your starting position.</p><h2>Bonuses and penalties to range of motion</h2><h3>Wealth</h3><p>The most obvious bonus to range of motion is access to wealth. With enough money, many problems become easy to solve. US$500 might get you from Cape Town to Mumbai if you're willing to wait until next week to leave. But if you're able to pay US$500,000, you can probably leave this afternoon. The advantage of money is that so many people need it, creating opportunities to exchange it with those who have the knowledge, equipment and spare time to solve your problems for you.</p><p>The downside of money is that not everyone has enough of it. Being broke limits your range of motion by limiting the number of problems you can easily solve. Things as mundane as eating lunch, having childcare, or staying warm at night are most easily solved with money. Its absence quickly gets in the way.</p><p>It’s possible to increase your access to wealth if you’re starting without much of it. But to do so, you’ll need to increase your range of motion in other ways.</p><h3>Knowledge</h3><p>Luckily, there are other means of boosting your range of motion.</p><p>Perhaps more pivotal than money, over the long term, is knowledge, whether acquired through formal education or through more practical experience. Knowledge allows you to imagine solutions to both your own problems, and to the problems of others. This may also be a path to having more money when starting with less. By having knowledge that others need, you can exchange that knowledge for money. But even without direct financial exchange, the right knowledge on its own will take you far. Knowledge lets you know when you're being lied to. Knowledge lets you understand how things work, giving you a starting point to make them work better.</p><p>Knowledge is also more accessible today than at any other time in human history. The importance of knowledge to range of motion, coupled with the modern ease of acquiring that knowledge, is the greatest opportunity available today. This fact is also one of the central motivators of this book. Take it seriously.</p><h3>Relationships</h3><p>Less democratic than knowledge, but even more powerful as an amplifier to range of motion, are relationships. Relationships create opportunities to gain knowledge, trade favors, access wealth, and join new communties. Relationships open doors that can lead to shortcuts on the path to your goals.</p><p>Relationships are often tangled up with other factors in your range of motion. Pursuing knowledge at an elite school will create relationships with other people who have an elite education. Because elite schools are so often populated by the wealthy, you may find that relationships with those who attended also bring you closer to wealth. Similarly, those born with wealth will inherit more relationships to other wealthy people than those who were born broke. This generational feedback loop is one of the factors that creates age-old complaint that “the rich get richer.”</p><p>If there’s something you want but don’t have, you have a better chance of finding a path to it the more relationships you’ve cultivated.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Related to knowledge, skills define the things you can do. These range from the creative to the practical, everything from drawing to singing to sewing to building cabinets. While knowledge informs many skills, they’re not just about what you know.</p><p>Skills are also about what you have practiced. The more time invested in a skill, the more effective you become at it. Because of this, skills are intertwined with another, crucial factor: spare time.</p><h3>Spare Time</h3><p>With spare time, you can invest in knowledge, develop new skills, further refine existing skills, pursue new relationships, and deepen existing relationships. Without spare time, it can be challenging to move forward toward your goals.</p><p>But what is spare time? It’s the time you have that isn’t already claimed by something essential to the survival of yourself or someone else. If you work long hours, you’ll be shorter on spare time than someone who doesn’t have to work, or works only part of the day or week.</p><h3>Social prejudices</h3><p>For some of us, social prejudices confer advantages to range of motion. “Prejudice” is a word with negative connotations, so it may be confusing to see it described as advantageous. The negative connotation comes from how unfair and arbitrary that pre-judgement is.</p><p>In many cultures, having a particular gender, skin color, romantic preference, or even last name can cause someone to judge you as more capable, intelligent or trustworthy compared to those who are different from you. Even arbitrary things like a person’s height can contribute positively, or negatively, to their perceived abilities as a leader.</p><p>Social prejudices may be the most frustrating factor in range of motion because we have the least control over them. You can work hard to acquire knowledge, develop relationships, even save money. But there is a limit to how much you can overcome social prejudices from moment to moment. These prejudices may permanently close doors to you, impose limits on the relationships you can develop, and act as a constant source of friction on the way to your goals.</p><p>Or, they may give you a constant, gentle, forward tug.</p><p>It’s completely arbitrary.</p><p>If you feel the friction of social prejudice in your own adventures, know that all is not lost. Adversity demands creativity. The reward for overcoming and outmaneuvering these arbitrary obstacles is greater resilience, more imaginative strategy, and a broader insight into the journeys of those around you. Those who win easily often do not understand the source of their accomplishments. Those who must plot their course thoughtfully can see the systems around them more clearly, finding themselves better able to discern between luck and hard work.</p><h3>Physical ability and cognition</h3><p>Range of motion takes on a literal dimension when we consider physical ability. Much of the world is built for those who are considered “able-bodied,” with meager considerations offered to the needs of those who differ from that expectation. In many ways, this is an extension of the social prejudices described above, but it can take on more concrete forms. Lack of thought for how a product, service or facility will meet the needs of those with different physical abilities or specific medical needs can entirely exclude people from easily meeting their goals—again, for entirely arbitrary reasons.</p><p>Even having a mind which works differently from what people expect can impact your range of motion. The ability to read social cues or otherwise comfortably participate in social interactions is an enormous advantage—and its absence a powerful disadvantage. Laboring beneath the weight of depression, anxiety or other afflictions of the mind can limit your ability to pursue and maintain focus on your goals.</p><h2>Increasing range of motion</h2><p>Some factors in your range of motion will feel stubbornly fixed. You can’t immediately change people’s social prejudices, and the changes you can make to your physical abilities are limited. You can’t choose to be born to a wealthy family. You may even find your spare time constrained by other responsibilities in your life.</p><p>Still, there are factors that are more malleable. With a bit of discipline, for regular investment, and creativity, to solve the problems of making those investments possible, you <em>can</em> increase your range of motion. Knowledge, skills and relationships can all be cultivated to improve your changes of meeting your goals.</p><p>The more investment made in increasing range of motion, the greater the returns. As you develop skills and knowledge, you’ll find more relationships with people who need you to solve their problems. With consistency and luck, this can turn into money—and deeper skills, sharper knowledge, developed from the time you’re paid to solve people’s problems. With more money comes more options for spare time, and thus more opportunity to invest in further skills and knowledge, more space to develop new relationships.</p><p>And so on.</p><div id="item-meta"><span>Tags: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/society">society</a></li><li><a href="/tags/autonomy">autonomy</a></li></ul></div></div></article></div><div id="sidebar"><a class="site-name" href="/">21st Century Strategy Guide</a><p class="description">A manual to the opportunities of our strange future.</p><div id="meta"><nav><h1>Sections</h1><ul><li><a href="/humans">Humans</a></li><li><a href="/computers">Computers</a></li><li><a href="/resources">Money</a></li></ul></nav></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
