They apply for the work through software, they receive jobs through software. Pay is managed, delivered, and often obscured by software. If one day they fall out of favor, software will inform them they are terminated.</p><p>Examples of the algorithmically disposable person include those who work for rideshare apps, digitally-enabled food delivery services, and even housekeepers. When a company treats you as an ADP, the immediate advantage for the company is legal flexibility. Through legal fictions like terming ADP’s “independent contractors,” companies can save considerable money by not providing protections and benefits traditionally offered to workers.</p><p>But the ADP is more than a legal dodge. You don’t need to look algorithmically disposable people in the eye when you fire them. Companies can offload the difficult conversation of separation to software. When an ADP falls behind on certain measures tracked by software, that software can inform the ADP their services are no longer needed. Thus, workers become rows in a database. With their relationship to a parent company entirely mediated through software, they have limited means of appealing adverse decisions. The software doesn’t talk back, and the company that owns the software can, once they reach a certain scale, quickly replace them.</p><p>Algorithmically disposable people are also vulnerable to wage manipulation. When you have no personal relationships to draw on, and a company has commodified your labor, it is a challenge to effectively negotiate your pay. ADP labor is, from the start, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_form_contract#Contracts_of_adhesion">contract of adhesion</a>. You take it or leave it.</p><p>But whereas the contracts of old have the benefits of clear terms and explicit numbers, algorithmically disposable people must contend with black box calculations of pay. Because they are termed “contractors,” they have limited recourse if pay slides below legal limits for “employees.”</p><p>You may read this and think that the plight of the algorithmically disposable person is unfair. This may be the greatest dark advantage of software-mediated labor. The software is indifferent to fairness, indifferent to kindness, indifferent to suffering. Whereas human supervisors may fudge schedules, pick favorites, or look the other way when a worker is going through a rough patch, software supervisors are consistent and exacting. Software is too simple for empathy.</p><p>Algorithmically disposable people have lost all power in their labor relations. They have been reduced to commodities that produce outcomes. Should those outcomes become unreliable, they are replaced.</p><p>The explosion of ADP-derived labor is a reflection of economic desperation as much as any technological development. In an economy where fair wages and worker security was in abundance, it would be difficult to operate this way. Software is not the root cause of this precarity—merely its lubricant.</p><p>Still, it must be stressed that gig software companies at scale create feedback loops that erode outcomes for workers. Success of these companies creates convenience and profits for a few, insecurity for many.</p><div id="item-meta"><span>Tags: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/explainer">explainer</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gigeconomy">gig-economy</a></li><li><a href="/tags/labor">labor</a></li></ul></div></div></article></div><div id="sidebar"><a class="site-name" href="/">21st Century Strategy Guide</a><p class="description">A manual to the hazards and opportunities of our strange future.</p><div id="meta"><nav><h1>Sections</h1><ul><li><a href="/humans">Humans</a></li><li><a href="/computers">Computers</a></li><li><a href="/resources">Money</a></li></ul></nav></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
